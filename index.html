<h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I have been working with computers for much of my life but used them mostly as a tool required for the work I was doing. I spent 35 years working for Schlumberger Oilfield Services much of the time in the field delivering drilling, logging and MWD services to clients worldwide. I have since retired and have decided to learn more about the inner workings of computers hence an interest in web development.</p>
